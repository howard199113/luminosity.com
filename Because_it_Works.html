<h1><span class="cushycms">Our Corporate Coaching Works:</span></h1>

<p><span class="cushycms">&quot;Luminosity Coaching helped us design and implement a Global Talent Management Program and implement a Professional Services Automation System. &nbsp;Dianne has a gift for asking the right questions and providing an objective viewpoint; grounded in experience. She was instrumental in building specific components and processes. These capabilities positioned our Business Intelligence team to be the clear leaders in Managed Analytics Services. We also improved our resource planning capabilities and have driven quantifiable utilization improvements.&nbsp;I strongly recommend Luminosity Coaching to any company &nbsp;wanting to effect positive change.&quot;</span></p>

<hr />
<p><span class="cushycms">&quot;I was surprised when my company engaged Dianne Savoie to support our client-facing employees through executive coaching, since our founder is very frugal on any sales related expenses for the firm.&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to expect but went in open minded since he invested in this resource to help me and the rest of our business development teams to improve performance.&nbsp; Having served the organization in a successful business development role, accounting for as much as 50% of our companies sales on a team of 7, many might think, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got this covered.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span class="cushycms">I went into our first session with an open mind and was delighted to hear that she was going to coach me from where I was, without a predetermined set of &ldquo;training&rdquo; techniques, and her first question opened a world of strategic conversations.&nbsp; She wanted to know what I wanted help with.&nbsp; Now, a year later, those coaching conversations have lead me to redefine my targets, create a more productive time management plan, and strategically working through prospect and client conversations in an environment that is empowering and motivating.&nbsp; Mostly, my focus improved.&nbsp; My close ratio has increased; my numbers are up 3 times that of the previous year, and my confidence in duplicating this process is strong.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span class="cushycms">I highly recommend executive coaching to anyone thinking about it.&nbsp; If you want someone that is able to meet you where you&rsquo;re at, has the executive presence and experience to understand your world, and will hold you capable and accountable - then Dianne Savoie is the one to help you.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="cushycms">&quot;Dianne played a fundamental role in making my new law practice successful. Her thoughtful insight and breadth of experience were essential elements in helping me be successful. Because of her assistance I have been able to develop a methodology and brand that has grown significantly over the last year. She also had a key role in helping me realize my personal keys to finding success. Dianne is a great coach, mentor,&nbsp;and now a great friend. I am very happy that we connected when we did.&quot;</span></p>

<hr />
<p><span class="cushycms">&quot;Dianne has a unique ability to push aside outdated approaches to leadership by implementing modern methods that drill down to the core values of a leader. When fully digested, Dianne&rsquo;s techniques will transform the average leader into the exceptional leader. Dianne&rsquo;s guidance is a must for anyone seeking to increase their leadership potential.&quot;&nbsp;</span></p>

<hr />
<p><span class="cushycms">&quot;I reluctantly went into this coaching agreement due to my already busy schedule and my belief that most things which created my stresses really could not be changed. What I learned through my experience of being coached were ways to view those things differently and ways to respond to them for a less stressful result.</span></p>

<p><span class="cushycms">In just two short months of working with Luminosity Coaching in one-to-one leadership coaching I have had several breakthroughs:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span class="cushycms">My strategic plans are more clear</span></li>
	<li><span class="cushycms">My overall communication skills have improved.</span></li>
	<li><span class="cushycms">I&#39;m more open to listening.</span></li>
	<li><span class="cushycms">I&#39;m making more time for free flowing discussions w/my team.</span></li>
	<li><span class="cushycms">I have a more positive approach to the work load.</span></li>
	<li><span class="cushycms">I&#39;m more focused and allowing.</span></li>
	<li><span class="cushycms">Discipline does NOT have to be hard!</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span class="cushycms">Don&#39;t let anyone or anything get in the way of you having a business coach and getting this kind of support. And stop right here, there is none better than Dianne Savoie. I honestly would not have made such quick strides with anyone else. She listened and heard what was unspoken, provided direction with encouragement, and somehow held me accountable to myself without pressure.</span></p>

<p><span class="cushycms">I highly recommend Luminosity Coaching to anyone wanting to achieve more for themselves, their company, and their staff.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="cushycms">&quot;Dianne is an excellent listener who addressed my needs with encouragement. She provided a place for me to create successful strategies for accomplishing my personal and business goals. The most important benefits I received through the leadership coaching I received are:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span class="cushycms">Insight and direction</span></li>
	<li><span class="cushycms">Inspiration and encouragement</span></li>
	<li><span class="cushycms">Explored possibilities that seemed unreachable</span></li>
